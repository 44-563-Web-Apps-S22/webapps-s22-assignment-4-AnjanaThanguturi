    <h4>The Miser</h4>
    <h5>This play was acted for the first time on September 9, 1668. In it,
        Molière has borrowed from Plautus, and has imitated several other
        authors, but he far surpasses them in the treatment of his subject.
        The picture of the miser, in whom love of money takes the place of all
        natural affections, who not only withdraws from family intercourse,
        but considers his children as natural enemies, is finely drawn, and
        renders Molière's Miser altogether more dramatic and moral than those
        of his predecessors.<br>
        Molière acted the part of Harpagon.<br><br>

    SCENE III.--HARPAGON, CLÉANTE.<br><br>

        HAR. Well, now, all consideration of stepmother aside, tell me what do
             you think of this lady?<br>

        CLE. What I think of her?<br>

        HAR. Yes, what do you think of her appearance, her figure, her beauty
             and intelligence?<br>

        CLE. So, so.<br>

        HAR. But still?<br>

        CLE. To tell you the truth, I did not find her such as I expected. Her
             manner is that of a thorough coquette, her figure is rather awkward,
             her beauty very middling, and her intelligence of the meanest order.
             Do not suppose that I say this to make you dislike her; for if I must
             have a stepmother, I like the idea of this one as well as of any
             other.<br>

        HAR. You spoke to her just now, nevertheless....<br>

        CLE. I paid her several compliments in your name, but it was to please
             you.<br>

        HAR. So then you don't care for her?<br>

        CLE. Who? I? Not in the least.<br>

        HAR. I am sorry for it, for that puts an end to a scheme which had
             occurred to me. Since I have seen her here, I have been thinking of my
             own age; and I feel that people would find fault with me for marrying
             so young a girl. This consideration had made me determine to abandon
             the project, and as I had demanded her in marriage, and had given her
             my promise, I would have given her to you if it were not for the
             dislike you have for her.<br>

        CLE. To me?<br>

        HAR. To you.<br>
