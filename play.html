    <h4>The Miser</h4>
    <img src="The Miser.jpg" alt="The Miser">
    <h5>This play was acted for the first time on September 9, 1668. In it, Molière has borrowed
        from Plautus, and has imitated several other authors, but he far surpasses them in the
        treatment of his subject.The picture of the miser, in whom love of money takes the place
        of all natural affections, who not only withdraws from family intercourse, but considers
        his children as natural enemies, is finely drawn, and renders Molière's Miser altogether
        more dramatic and moral than those of his predecessors.<br>
        Molière acted the part of Harpagon.<br><br>

    <h6 class="name HARPAGON"><i class="fa fa-user"></i> HAR.</h6>
    <p class="speech"> Well, now, all consideration of stepmother aside, tell me what do you think of this lady?</p>

    <h6 class="name CLÉANTE"><i class="fa fa-user"></i> CLE.</h6>
    <p class="speech">What I think of her?</p>

    <h6 class="name HARPAGON"><i class="fa fa-user"></i> HAR.</h6>
    <p class="speech">Yes, what do you think of her appearance, her figure, her beauty and intelligence?</p>

    <h6 class="name CLÉANTE"><i class="fa fa-user"></i> CLE.</h6>
    <p class="speech">So, so.</p>

    <h6 class="name HARPAGON"><i class="fa fa-user"></i> HAR.</h6>
    <p class="speech">But still?</p>

    <h6 class="name CLÉANTE"><i class="fa fa-user"></i> CLE.</h6>
    <p class="speech">To tell you the truth, I did not find her such as I expected. Her manner is that of a
        thorough coquette, her figure is rather awkward, her beauty very middling, and her
        intelligence of the meanest order.Do not suppose that I say this to make you dislike her;
        for if I must have a stepmother, I like the idea of this one as well as of any other.</p>

    <h6 class="name HARPAGON"><i class="fa fa-user"></i> HAR.</h6>
    <p class="speech">You spoke to her just now, nevertheless....</p>

    <h6 class="name CLÉANTE"><i class="fa fa-user"></i> CLE.</h6>
    <p class="speech">I paid her several compliments in your name, but it was to please you.</p>

    <h6 class="name HARPAGON"><i class="fa fa-user"></i> HAR.</h6>
    <p class="speech">So then you don't care for her?</p>

    <h6 class="name CLÉANTE"><i class="fa fa-user"></i> CLE.</h6>
    <p class="speech">Who? I? Not in the least.</p>

    <h6 class="name HARPAGON"><i class="fa fa-user"></i> HAR.</h6>
    <p class="speech">I am sorry for it, for that puts an end to a scheme which had occurred to me. Since I have
        seen her here, I have been thinking of my own age; and I feel that people would find fault
        with me for marrying so young a girl. This consideration had made me determine to
        abandon the project, and as I had demanded her in marriage, and had given her my promise,
        I would have given her to you if it were not for the dislike you have for her.</p>

    <h6 class="name CLÉANTE"><i class="fa fa-user"></i> CLE.</h6>
    <p class="speech">To me?</p>

    <h6 class="name HARPAGON"><i class="fa fa-user"></i> HAR.</h6>
    <p class="speech">To you.</p>

    <p class="speech">Ah! Sir, you are just in
        the nick of time. Quick! follow me.</p>

    <h6 class="name CLÉANTE"><i class="fa fa-user"></i> CLE.</h6>
    <p class="speech">What is the matter?</p>

    <h6 class="name LAFLÈCHE"><i class="fa fa-user"></i> LA FL.</h6>
    <p class="speech">Follow me, I say. We are saved.</p>

    <h6 class="name CLÉANTE"><i class="fa fa-user"></i> CLE.</h6>
    <p class="speech">How?</p>

    <h6 class="name LAFLÈCHE"><i class="fa fa-user"></i> LA FL.</h6>
    <p class="speech">Here is all you want.</p>

    <h6 class="name CLÉANTE"><i class="fa fa-user"></i> CLE.</h6>
    <p class="speech">What?</p>

    <h6 class="name LAFLÈCHE"><i class="fa fa-user"></i> LA FL.</h6>
    <p class="speech">I have watched for this all day.</p>

    <h6 class="name CLÉANTE"><i class="fa fa-user"></i> CLE.</h6>
